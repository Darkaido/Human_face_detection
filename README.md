# Face_detection

## Introduction
The objective of this project to make an end to end computer vision project and detect faces,eyes and facial_keypoints.

We use various libraries like opencv,streamlit, dlib etc. to make this project. we use cascade classifiers for detecting faces and eyes while we use dlib for finding facial landmarks or keypoints and top of that we use streamlit to make it an end to end project.
